# Agentic-AI-Travel-Planner
### Welcome to the Agentic AI Trip Planner Project!
This repository contains an innovative AI-driven trip planning application. The project leverages the power of AI agents, utilizing the AutoGen framework, OpenAI LLMs, and LLAMA Index to create a seamless and interactive trip planning tool.
The core of the application is the Conversable Agent, an AI-driven entity capable of understanding and responding to user queries. It interacts with users in a conversational manner, providing suggestions, answering questions, and offering trip planning advice.
### Features
- **_Conversable AI Agent_**: Engage in natural conversations with an AI agent that assists in trip planning.
- **_Human-AI Interaction_**: Collaborate with an AI agent while retaining control over decisions and inputs.
- **_Group Chat with Round Robin Speaker Selection_**: Efficiently manage discussions and planning in group settings.
- **_Contextual Awareness_**: The AI can recall and use information from previous conversations to improve the planning process.
- **_Wikipedia Tool Integration_**: Ensure accuracy and reliability in trip information with real-time Wikipedia data.
